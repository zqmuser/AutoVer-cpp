DUAL-PURPOSE SOFTWARE LICENSE

NAME:  The dual-purpose license for software

PURPOSES and INTENT:

* To allow both open source and proprietary development of the software.
* To allow versions of the software to transition between open source and
proprietary development.
* To discourage anti-competitive practices.
* To have a readable license agreement.
* To encourage good practices by both software developers and users.
* To address concerns by those using the software that the software could one 
day be unavailable.

LICENSE TERMS:

    This license can be modified for your product, but once attached to a 
product the only allowed modification to the license is activating or 
deactivating the optional clause, and designating if it is a proprietary
or open source copy of the software.
    This software can be developed as both public domain and proprietary 
versions or code tree branches.
    Multiple organizations may make proprietary versions based on the public 
domain version of the code.
    Code in the public domain must remain accessible in the public domain.
    Any organization can use some or all of the public domain code to make a 
proprietary commercial product.  Additions to the software made by an 
organization as part of a commercial product can remain proprietary if the 
company is meeting one or more of these criteria.
* The software is being actively developed.
* The software is being sold at a competitive price.
* The organization offers contract research services using the software at a
  competitive price.
* The organization is using the software internally for the development of its 
  products.
    If a commercial version of the software no longer meets any of these 
criteria, the organization is required to contribute the code, with all 
changes and additions they have made, back to the public domain.
    If sales of commercial version are discontinued, a copy of the code at that 
point must be made public domain (even if the software will still be 
developed and used in house).
    Proprietary code, or portions of it, can be contributed to the public 
domain version at the maker's discretion.
    New code contributed to the public domain version can be integrated into 
proprietary versions.
    Functionality may not be removed from the public domain version.
* This does not preclude fixing bugs.
* If functionality is unsuccessful or replaced, the old code can be kept but 
  have no call path to use it, put in a source file not included in the link, 
  commented out, or preserved by some similar method.
* This requirement should not limit the ability of developers to make 
  updates, improvements, or additions to the code.
    Open source versions must be available free or "at cost" in a form that is 
usable and relatively easy to install/compile by the end user.
    Open source versions can also be sold or repackaged for sale (i.e. sold as 
a compiled product, as part of a software collection, or with a more
convenient installer, etc.).
    Proprietary versions can be available for a charge (including annual, node 
locked, floating, per hour, perpetual, source code, cloud, various discounts, 
libraries, API access, and any other options), with no free option required 
(but it is allowed).
    Proprietary versions can have a license enforcement mechanism added, but it 
must be removed or easily disabled in open source versions.

SCOPE:

    The terms of this license extends to any software for which the majority 
of its functionality is only usable in conjunction with software under this 
license.  There can be proprietary extensions to open source code and 
open source extensions to proprietary code (i.e. pre and post processing).
    Once a body of code is put under this license agreement, it and its future 
versions and extensions remain under this license agreement in perpetuity.
    This license does NOT extend to products (i.e. chemical compounds) 
developed through the use of this software.
    This license puts NO restrictions or requirements on those developing or 
using the software to publish methods, results, performance comparisons, etc.
    This license can be applied to software that began open source only, or 
began proprietary only.
    The software can be distributed under other names, as long as this license 
is included.

DEVELOPER OBLIGATIONS:

    Those developing the code must make a good faith effort to make 
functioning, bug free software.
    Those developing the code must make a good faith effort to make the code 
perform its stated function (within the limitations of the underlying 
mathematical approximations, algorithm, etc.).
    Those developing the code must make a good faith effort to provide good 
documentation, including input examples, and a discussion of when or why a 
given feature would be used (if not obvious).
    Those developing the code must make a good faith effort to follow good 
software development practices where applicable.

USER OBLIGATIONS:

    Those using the software have an obligation to report any bugs, 
limitations, or problems encountered in using the code, if not already 
reported or documented.
    Those using the software have an obligation to determine situations in 
which the methods (which may be only approximations) may give qualitatively or
quantitatively incorrect results, and to use the software accordingly.

BOTH:

    Both developers and users of the software have an obligation to keep this 
license agreement with the software, both when the software is in source 
code form and in executable form.

LIABILITY:

    Users may not hold developers liable for any failings of the software to 
work as expected.
    Developers may not hold users liable for failures to use the software in an 
appropriate manner.

OPTIONAL: (designate if activated or deactivated)

ACTIVATED The software must be used for peaceful, civilian purposes. It may not
be used for development or testing of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.

PROPRIETARY OR OPEN SOURCE: (designate one)

    This is an OPEN SOURCE version of the source code and software.

END OF LICENSE


SUPPLEMENTAL CLARIFICATION

    One example of an anti-competitive practice prohibited by this license is 
removing functionality for import/export in a format that is interoperable with other software.

    Reasons for considering deactivating the optional clause.
* The software might be needed to fight some future Hitler in some future
Manhattan project.
* This clause may prevent the developers from getting government grants.
Even if it doesn't now, government regulations change over time.
* This clause would almost certainly decrease the income of a commercial
product, but how much is unknown.
